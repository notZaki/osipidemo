# Create a copy of the respository and contribute changes


*Note: The guidelines and instructions presented in this document use examples evaluated on the macOS operating system. Where applicable, links referencing documentation to perform the same task on a different operating system has been provided. Please note that these links may not be exhaustive and we welcome users to report any issues they face while working through the steps outlined, on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/OSIPI/TF2.3-CodeLibrary/issues) for the repository.*

## Setup a local copy of the repository
To create a local copy of the repository, navigate to the respository located at [OSIPI DCE/DSC Code Library](https://github.com/OSIPI/TF2.3-CodeLibrary), and use the repository url from the **CODE** drop down menu (shown in the figure below).

On the local computer, open the terminal application and navigate to the folder where you would like the repository to be located. `git clone` is then used to clone a local copy of the repository..
 
	$git clone https://github.com/OSIPI/DCE-DSC-MRI_CodeCollection.git

Now you will have a local copy wherein any additions, modifications or deletions made would remain local to your computer and not immediately affect the repository housed on GitHub. To obtain information about the repository enter

	$git status
	
The output will look something similar to

## Working with a specific branch of the repository
The **master** branch of the repository is checked out initially by default. To switch to a specific branch - let's say the branch name is **OsipiTaskForce**, use `git checkout` as follows.

	$git checkout -b OsipiTaskForce
	
Branching in Git is a powerful tool when working on new or developmental features of a project. Specific to Task Force 2.3, each milestone / deliverable will have a unique branch named **Milestone-X / Deliverable-X**. 

While working on a new feature for a particular milestone/deliverable, it is encouraged to check out a new branch during its development and generate a pull request on GitHub. This will enable the feature branch (compare) to be merged into **Milestone-X / Deliverable-X** (base).

## Submitting local changes to the remote repository
New files created within the local version of the repository will show up as *untracked* files unless explicitly added to the repository.
	
	$git add new_file_in_repository
	
The changes made to the *tracked* files are then commited to the local repository before being pushed to the remote repository on GitHub. 

	$git commit -m "Commit message"

`git commit` commits changes made to all *tracked* files. At this point, these changes are still only reflected on the checked out branch of the local repository. For these changes to be reflected on the remote repository on GitHub, the local changes have to be pused. If performing `git push` for the first time on a new branch, the upstream connection has to be established with the remote location by the following command

	$git push --set-upstream origin OsipiTaskForce

where **OsipiTaskForce** is the new branch as specified in the earlier examples. If the upstream connection has already been established then a simple

	$git push
command is sufficient for the local changes ot be reflected on the remote repository.
